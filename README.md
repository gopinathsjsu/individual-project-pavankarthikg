# Problem Statement 

We designed and implemented a forum -java application where users can order and purchase products. The forum has all the information regarding the item needed. There is a limit on the number of items like Essentials are restricted to a maximum of 3, Luxury to 4, and Miscellaneous to 6. The application validates if the requested quantity for each item is permissible or not. Once the validation is done, if the cart is valid, application adds prices and displays the total amount and card details will be used for payment process else displays a txt file - Please correct quantities.

# Instructions to run the application

Go to repo individual-project-praneetha-moturi and clone the repository or download the zip file.
You need Visual studio code IDE to run the code.

Open the zipped folder or the entire folder in VSCode using Open Project.

After opening the project go to src/inventory --> InventoryMain.java, compile and run the project.

If the java version is not compatible please download the correct JDK version ( Oracle JDK 17).
* Install java extensions in visual studio code.

Build and run the code next and you will get the output displayed in Sample-Output.csv file.

Output is displayed in the terminal and Sample-Output.csv file or for the errors the logs.txt file is generated and can check the same in the project folder under Sample-Output.csv or logs.txt

For each output file, change the input to be given like "input1-Shee1.csv" or "input2-Sheet1.csv" according to inputs. For additional inputs other than the 3 mentioned, add extra input file to .csv files and repeat the same to run the code.
